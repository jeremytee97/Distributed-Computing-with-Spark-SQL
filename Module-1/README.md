# Module-1 Introduction to Spark
In this module, I learned how discuss the core concepts of distributed computing and be able to recognize when and where to apply them. 

I was exposed to the basic data structure of Apache Sparkâ„¢, known as a DataFrame. Then, I was introduced to use the collaborative Databricks workspace and write SQL code that executes against a cluster of machines.
